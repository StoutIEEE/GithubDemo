This repository will be used to show you da wae.


[**um Something**]

Pete looked at the warped gun in his hands and felt delighted.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his chilly surroundings. He had always loved Uganda with its dirty, dripping da queen. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel delighted.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Knuckle. Knuckles was a thoughtless knows de wae with handsome feet and hairy fingers.

Pete gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a loving, giving, cocoa drinker with red feet and sloppy fingers. His friends saw him as a dirty, dripping doesn't know de wae. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved an expensive da queen.

But not even a loving person who had once jumped into a river and saved an expensive da queen, was prepared for what Knuckles had in store today.

The wind blew like spit toads, making Pete sparkly.

As Pete stepped outside and Knuckles came closer, he could see the square glint in his eye.

"I am here to show you da wae" Knuckles bellowed, in a funny tone. He slammed his fist against Pete's chest, with the force of 1287 dogs. "You do not know da wae"

Pete looked back, even more sparkly and still fingering the warped gun. "Knuckles, I love you, I am your father," he replied.

They looked at each other with jumpy feelings, like two harsh, hilarious hamsters showing the wae at a very modest rave, which had piano music playing in the background and two wild uncles hopping to the beat.

Suddenly, Knuckles lunged forward and tried to punch Pete in the face. Quickly, Pete grabbed the warped gun and brought it down on Knuckles's skull.

Knuckles's handsome feet trembled and his hairy fingers wobbled. He looked sleepy, his body raw like a rare, raspy record.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Knuckles was dead.

Pete went back inside and made himself a nice mug of cocoa.
